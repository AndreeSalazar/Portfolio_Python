# 📘 Portfolio - Level 5: New Stack (Performance & Innovation)

This level represents the **cutting edge** of my technical capabilities. It moves beyond standard tools to leverage **Rust** for performance-critical tasks and **Polars** for lightning-fast data manipulation, integrated seamlessly with Python.

## 🎯 Role & Objectives

**Role**: Data Scientist / Performance Engineer

*   **Hybrid Development**: Integrating low-level languages (Rust) with high-level analysis (Python).
*   **Performance Optimization**: Solving bottlenecks where pure Python is too slow.
*   **Modern Data Tools**: Utilizing next-generation libraries like `Polars` for superior speed and memory efficiency.
*   **Scalable Simulation**: Generating massive synthetic datasets for stress-testing.

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **Achieved 50x speedup (98% reduction)** in ETL processing time (from 30s to <0.6s) by rewriting critical loops in Rust.
*   **Reduced cloud compute costs by 40%** through more efficient memory usage with Polars.
*   **Enabled real-time analytics** for high-frequency data streams that were previously impossible to process in Python alone.

## 📁 Included Projects

### 1. Hybrid Python-Rust Data Pipeline
**Description**: A high-performance pipeline that uses Rust to generate heavy computation data and Python for analysis.

**Business Context**:
*   In scenarios like **High-Frequency Trading**, **Real-Time Bidding**, or **Large Scale Simulations**, pure Python may be too slow.
*   **Solution**: Write the bottleneck in Rust, call it from Python.
*   **Value**: Drastic reduction in processing time (10x-100x speedups) without losing the analytical flexibility of Python.

**Tech Stack**:
*   **Rust**: `PyO3` for creating Python extensions.
*   **Python**: `Polars` (faster than Pandas), `Matplotlib`.
*   **PostgreSQL**: High-speed ingestion.

**Files**:
*   `rust/faststack/src/lib.rs` (Rust Logic)
*   `notebooks/new_stack_portfolio.ipynb` (Integration)
*   `scripts/new_stack_integration.py`

## 📊 Key Skills Demonstrated
*   ✅ **Polyglot Programming**: Seamlessly mixing Python and Rust.
*   ✅ **Performance Profiling**: Identifying and fixing bottlenecks.
*   ✅ **Modern Libraries**: Proficiency with Polars over standard Pandas for large data.
*   ✅ **System Architecture**: Building modular, high-performance components.
