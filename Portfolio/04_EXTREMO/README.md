# 📘 Portfolio - Level 4: EXTREME (Big Data & Engineering)

This level demonstrates my capability to handle **Big Data** and highly complex projects: datasets with millions of rows, extreme PostgreSQL optimization, chunk processing, and advanced Machine Learning pipelines.

## 🎯 Role & Objectives

**Role**: Big Data Analyst / Data Engineer

*   **Big Data Solutions**: Designing analytics for massive datasets (e.g., massive e-commerce, sales time series).
*   **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing PostgreSQL with partitioning, advanced indexing, and materialized views.
*   **Efficient Processing**: Handling data that doesn't fit in memory (chunking, parallelization).
*   **Advanced ML**: Feature engineering at scale, cross-validation, and tuning.
