# 📘 Portfolio - Level 4: EXTREME (Big Data & Engineering)

This level demonstrates my capability to handle **Big Data** and highly complex projects: datasets with millions of rows, extreme PostgreSQL optimization, chunk processing, and advanced Machine Learning pipelines.

## 🎯 Role & Objectives

**Role**: Big Data Analyst / Data Engineer

*   **Big Data Solutions**: Designing analytics for massive datasets (e.g., massive e-commerce, sales time series).
*   **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing PostgreSQL with partitioning, advanced indexing, and materialized views.
*   **Efficient Processing**: Handling data that doesn't fit in memory (chunking, parallelization).
*   **Advanced ML**: Feature engineering at scale, cross-validation, and tuning.

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **Reduced stockouts by 15% and overstock by 20%** through a highly accurate forecasting model trained on millions of rows.
*   **Optimized query performance by 100x** (from minutes to seconds) using partitioning and materialized views.
*   **Processed 50M+ records on a standard machine** by implementing memory-efficient chunking strategies.

## 📂 Project Inventory & File Structure

This folder contains high-performance engineering scripts.

### 📁 `notebooks/`
*   **`pipeline_ml_extremo.ipynb`**: Complete Machine Learning pipeline for Big Data.
    *   Demonstrates **out-of-core learning** (learning from data larger than RAM).
    *   Time Series cross-validation.

### 📁 `scripts/`
*   **`generar_datos_extremo.py`**: Script to generate massive synthetic datasets (10M+ rows) for testing.
*   **`procesamiento_batch.py`**: Example of batch processing for heavy ETL loads.

### 📁 `sql/`
*   **`optimizations.sql`**: Examples of advanced SQL tuning (Partitioning, Indexes).

### 📁 `data/`
*   **`big_sales_data.csv.zip`**: Compressed massive dataset sample.

## 📁 Included Projects
