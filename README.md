Welcome to my professional Data Analyst portfolio. This repository demonstrates my journey from fundamental data analysis to advanced big data engineering and modern high-performance stacks.

It is structured to show not just *technical skills*, but the **business value** I can deliver.

## 📊 Visual Gallery (Insights & Results)

*Evidence of analysis, dashboards, and performance benchmarks.*

| **Sales Trend Analysis** | **Churn by Segment** |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Monthly Sales](images/monthly_sales_growth.png) | ![Churn Analysis](images/churn_by_segment.png) |
| *Identified 20% growth in Q4 driven by seasonal demand.* | *High churn (25%) in Bronze segment suggests pricing issues.* |

| **Business Correlation** | **Performance Optimization** |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_matrix.png) | ![Performance Benchmark](images/performance_benchmark.png) |
| *Found strong correlation (0.85) between discount and sales volume.* | *Reduced ETL time from 30s to 0.6s (50x speedup) using Rust.* |

## 🌟 Featured Projects (Start Here)

These projects simulate real-world scenarios using datasets inspired by **Kaggle** (Store Sales, Olist E-commerce) and synthetic big data generation.

### 1. **[Featured_1_BigData_Forecasting.ipynb](./Featured_1_BigData_Forecasting.ipynb)** (Retail & Inventory)
*   **Business Problem**: A large retail chain faces **stockouts** during peak seasons and **overstock** in off-seasons.
*   **Solution**: Built a Time Series Forecasting model trained on **millions of rows** to predict demand per store/item.
*   **Impact**: **Reduced stockouts by 15%** and overstock by **20%** in simulation, optimizing working capital.
*   **Tech**: Big Data Processing, Time Series ML (Scikit-Learn).

### 2. **[Featured_2_HighPerformance_Rust.ipynb](./Featured_2_HighPerformance_Rust.ipynb)** (High-Frequency Data)
*   **Business Problem**: Legacy Python ETL pipelines were taking too long (>30s) to process real-time bidding data, causing missed opportunities.
*   **Solution**: Rewrote critical bottleneck loops in **Rust** and integrated them via `PyO3` & `Polars`.
*   **Impact**: **Speedup of 50x** (from 30s to <0.6s), enabling real-time analytics.
*   **Tech**: Rust (PyO3), Polars, Hybrid Pipelines.

### 3. **[Featured_3_Business_Analytics.ipynb](./Featured_3_Business_Analytics.ipynb)** (E-commerce Strategy)
*   **Business Problem**: Understanding customer lifecycle value (LTV) to optimize marketing spend.
*   **Solution**: Conducted end-to-end Cohort Analysis and RFM Segmentation.
*   **Impact**: Identified "Gold" segments with **30% higher LTV**, recommending a shift in ad spend towards similar profiles.
*   **Tech**: Advanced SQL, Cohort Analysis, Segmentation.

## 🌟 Why Me?

As a Data Analyst, I bridge the gap between **raw data** and **strategic decision-making**.

*   **Business-Oriented**: Every analysis starts with a business question ("How to reduce churn?", "Where to invest?").
*   **Technically Versatile**: From Excel/SQL to Python/Rust.
*   **Scalable**: Handling CSVs to Big Data partitions.

## 🚀 Live Demo

I have included a **Streamlit** dashboard script to demonstrate how I turn analysis into interactive tools.
Run it locally:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
