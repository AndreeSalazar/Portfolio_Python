# 🚀 Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my professional Data Analyst portfolio. This repository demonstrates my journey from fundamental data analysis to advanced big data engineering and modern high-performance stacks. 

It is structured to show not just *technical skills*, but the **business value** I can deliver.

## � Featured Projects (Start Here)

If you want to see my code immediately, check these notebooks in the root folder:

## 🌟 Why Me?

As a Data Analyst, I bridge the gap between **raw data** and **strategic decision-making**.

*   **Business-Oriented**: Every analysis starts with a business question.
*   **Technically Versatile**: From Excel/SQL to Python/Rust.
*   **Scalable**: Handling CSVs to Big Data partitions.
