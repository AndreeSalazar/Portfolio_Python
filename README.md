# 🚀 Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my professional Data Analyst portfolio. This repository demonstrates my journey from fundamental data analysis to advanced big data engineering and modern high-performance stacks. 

It is structured to show not just *technical skills*, but the **business value** I can deliver as a Data Analyst.

## 🌟 Why Me?

As a Data Analyst, I bridge the gap between **raw data** and **strategic decision-making**. My portfolio demonstrates that I am:

*   **Business-Oriented**: Every analysis starts with a business question (e.g., "How to reduce churn?", "Which products drive revenue?").
*   **Technically Versatile**: I don't just use Excel; I leverage **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for robust data modeling, **Python** for advanced analytics/ML, and even **Rust** for high-performance data processing.
*   **Scalable**: I understand how to handle small datasets (CSV) to big data scenarios (partitioning, optimization, cloud-ready pipelines).
*   **Full-Stack Analyst**: From ETL and Data Cleaning to Visualization and Predictive Modeling.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| **Core Languages** | Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Rust (for performance) |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL (Advanced optimization, Indexing, Partitioning) |
| **Data Analysis** | Pandas, Polars, SciPy |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau/PowerBI ready datasets |
| **Big Data & Ops** | Docker (implied), ETL Pipelines, Memory Optimization |
