# 📘 Portfolio - Level 3: Advanced (Senior Data Analyst)

This level is designed to show **how I work in a production-like environment**: professional data architecture, end-to-end business analysis, predictive models, and automated reporting for leadership.

## 🎯 Role & Objectives

**Role**: Senior Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer

*   **Lead Analysis**: From objective definition to strategic conclusions.
*   **Data Architecture**: Designing schemas for reporting and scalability.
*   **Robust ETL**: Building pipelines that handle errors and large volumes.
*   **Predictive Modeling**: Using ML to solve business problems (not just for accuracy).
*   **Automation**: Reducing manual work through scripted reporting.

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **Identified segments with 30% higher LTV**, leading to a targeted marketing strategy.
*   **Reduced churn by 5%** by proactively flagging at-risk customers with a predictive model.
*   **Automated weekly reporting**, saving the team **10+ hours per week** of manual data gathering.

## 📂 Project Inventory & File Structure

This folder mimics a production environment. Here is what you will find:

### 📁 `notebooks/`
*   **`analisis_avanzado_datos.ipynb`**: The core analysis notebook. It contains:
    *   Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis).
    *   Cohort Analysis (Retention over time).
    *   Profitability Analysis by Category.
    *   **Interactive Visualizations** (Plotly/Seaborn).

### 📁 `data/`
*   **`ecommerce_data.csv`** (or generated): The raw transactional dataset.
*   **`processed_metrics.parquet`**: Optimized storage for analytical outputs.

### 📄 Root Files
*   **`portfolio_avanzado.db`**: SQLite database demonstrating local database management for analysis.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Project dependencies for reproducibility.

## 📁 Included Projects

### 1. Complete Business Analysis System
**Description**: End-to-end design of a data model, optimization, and analytical flow.

**Business Context**:
*   A digital business (e-commerce/banking) with multiple data sources.
*   **Need**: A "Single Source of Truth" for direction (Revenue, Margin, Performance).
*   **Questions Answered**: What are the main revenue drivers? Which segments are most profitable?

**Tech Stack**:
*   **PostgreSQL**: Advanced optimization, Indexes, Materialized Views.
*   **Python**: Modular ETL architecture.

### 2. Predictive Business Analytics
**Description**: Building models that provide **actionable value** (e.g., forecasting, churn prediction).

**Business Context**:
*   Historical data is useful, but the business needs to anticipate the future.
*   **Need**: Forecast demand or identify risky customers.
*   **Value**: Proactive decision making instead of reactive.

**Tech Stack**:
*   **Python**: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`.
*   **PostgreSQL**: Data preparation.
